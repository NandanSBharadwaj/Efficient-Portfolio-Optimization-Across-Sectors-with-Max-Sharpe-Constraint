This project implements a data-driven portfolio optimization strategy using historical stock prices across multiple sectors. Leveraging yfinance for real-time data retrieval and the PyPortfolioOpt library for advanced optimization, the model constructs a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio while enforcing a per-asset weight constraint (no more than 3% in any single stock). The process includes calculating expected returns, risk (via the sample covariance matrix), and producing a clean, interpretable set of allocation weights.
In addition to optimization, the project visualizes the Efficient Frontier and highlights the tangency portfolio â€” the one offering the best risk-adjusted return. This provides both analytical insight and practical decision support for asset allocation. By balancing diversification, return expectations, and real-world constraints, the model demonstrates the application of modern portfolio theory to large-scale, real-world datasets.
